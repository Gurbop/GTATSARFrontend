## GTATSAR: Team Goals

New trimester, new teams. Our team goals this trimester are:

- Learn as we complete projects
- Prepare for the AP test by reviewing over CB mc and frq, as well as following popcorn hacks in projects
- to make possible additions or finishing touches to our CPT project from last trimester
